Neural Style Transfer

测试环境：ubuntu 18.04, python 3.6.5

## Setup
### Dependencies
this depends on the following libraries:
* Tensorflow (>=1.9.0)
* OpenCV

For detailed steps to install Tensorflow, follow the [Tensorflow installation
instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/). A typical user can install
Tensorflow using one of the following commands:

``` bash
# For CPU
pip install tensorflow
# For GPU
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

For detailed steps to install Tensorflow, follow the[Install OpenCV-Python 
in Ubuntu](https://docs.opencv.org/4.0.0-beta/d2/de6/tutorial_py_setup_in_ubuntu.html). 
A typical user can install OpenCV using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-opencv
```

## Quick Start
just run obj_detect.py and you will see the result.
